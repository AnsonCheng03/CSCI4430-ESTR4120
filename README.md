## Course outline
CSCI 4430 takes a top-down approach to explore how networks operate and how network applications work. We study how popular distributed systems such as video streaming, content distribution networks (CDNs), and cloud computing systems work in the application layer. We explore how these applications transfer data between their components and end users over the Internet using transport layer protocols such as TCP and UDP. We go deeper to understand what keeps the transport layer running; specifically, we look at how packets are routed and how routers work. Finally, we dive one more layer down to understand how the link layer transfer packets using Ethernet. In addition to cutting through the layers and covering the basics, we learn about the state-of-the-art topics in networking such as datacenter networks, software-defined networking (SDN), and (time permits) programmable networks.

From a practical point of view, we learn what sockets are and how to use them. And we write code. We write code to implement various protocols, to build client-server applications, video streaming applications, and transport protocols.

### Textbook (optional)
The course materials are based upon the following classic textbook of Kurose and Ross. In addition, many materials are also borrowed heavily from [Mosharaf Chowdhury](http://www.mosharaf.com/)'s [computer networks](https://github.com/mosharaf/eecs489) course with his permission. Credit is given whenever possible to Mosharaf and a lot of other folks.
- Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th. (or earlier editions), by Jim Kurose and Keith Ross, 2016. ISBN 978-0133594140.

### Grading
| Assessment item | ENGG Weight | ESTR Weight
| :---------------- | :--- | :--- | 
| Assignments | 55% | 45%
| Tutorial Quizzes* | 5% | 5%
| Final Exam | 40% | 40%
| Project | - | 10%

\*: To encourage tutorial participation, quiz will be conducted at the tutorials randomly. We will randomly pick 5 tutorials and perform a quiz at the end of the tutorial. Each quiz is worth one mark.

### ESTR students
ESTR 4120 follows the same format as CSCI 4430, but with an additional project to be presented in the second half of the semester. The exams and quizzes will be the same as CSCI 4430.

Projects details will be announced in a later time.

## Course policies
- *Special teaching arrangement* for students who cannot enter HK:
  * ENGG 2760A: both live Zoom sessions and recordings will be provided on this site for each lecture and tutorial. Recordings will also be available on Blackboard.
  * ESTR 2018: both live Zoom sessions and recordings will be provided on this site for each lecture and tutorial.
  * Inform the course instructor, Henry, **immediately** when you can physically attend the class, so we can avoid the hassle of hybrid mode teaching.
- Homework and project: 
  * Submit via Blackboard. You are automatically enrolled in the Blackboard course. We will create entries specifically for each item, and they will close automatically after the deadline. Marks will be available by end of weekend also on Blackboard.
  * Submit PDF files only. Other file format will be marked as zero. You can handwrite and scan as PDF, or simply write your solution using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) (All our homework and solutions are written in LaTeX).
  * No late submission. No exception.
  * According to the Universityâ€™s regulation, every assignment must be accompanied by a signed declaration of originality; submissions without it will receive zero mark.
  * The declaration form is available [here](declaration_en.doc).
- Lecture and tutorial:
  * Be on time. Set your mobile device to vibration/silient mode.
  * Feel free to ask questions and raise comments during the lecture, but we can only entertain short questions and discussions in-class.
  * Longer and deeper discussion and questions can happen in tutorials.
  * Follow University's regulations on COVID, including use of masks, hand sanitization, seating with social distance, etc.
