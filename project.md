# ESTR 4120 Project, Spring 2023

## Requirements

The project is worth 5 marks. Projects are individual-based. They will be delivered with an individual-based presentation.

### Topics
The ESTR lectures and optional readings can be used as project leads, but you can feel free to choose your own topic. Anything related to what we talk about in lectures is okay.

You may seek consultation with Henry if you are unsure about the topic.

### Timeline:
- Mar 10 11:59pm: **1 mark** Email Henry the topic with a simple abstract (1 or 2 paragraphs with some references) to explain the topic.
- Apr 11, 18, : **4 marks** In-class presentations.

### Presentation:
Each presentation lasts for 11 minutes in total: 1 minute for set-up, 9 minutes for the actual talk, and 2 minutes for Q&A. Tips for presentation will be added here later.

### Expectations:
An ideal project/presentation should deliver an exciting story. This means it should state the problem clearly, discuss the background and related work (i.e. what's missing here), present your new idea, present any experiments or analysis or proofs to concretely show the improvements, and finally conclude by discussing its limitations and possible future work.

It is not mandatory to have a completely new idea for the project (which is obviously very hard). You may choose to do a survey or a comparison of existing solutions. Or you may present a new problem that you identify and try to convince us it is non-trivial and important, without having a solution yet. But the key element I'm looking for is your own thinking and your own hands-on effort. So it's critical to present your thinking (and any conclusion you arrive at), as well as any experiments/analysis you perform in your presentation, if you are looking for a good score.
